The Flesch–Kincaid helpers (fk_level, count_syl) implement the standard
formula shown in the lecture slides (0.39·W/S + 11.8·S/W – 15.59).
Minor refactoring ideas (e.g. using pandas sort_values, nlp.pipe batching)
were suggested by ChatGPT (OpenAI o3, Jun 2025).

The tf-idf/ scikit-learn pipeline (tfidf_split & train_and_report scaffolds)
and several parameter-tuning ideas were suggested via ChatGPT (OpenAI o3, Jun 2025)
and adapted and integrated to satisfy the 3000 feature constraint.

External libraries (pandas, NLTK, scikit-learn, spaCy) are used under their respective
open-source licences.
