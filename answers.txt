Answers to the text questions go here.

Broken-up or headline text
Tweets, bullet lists, chat snippets and news headlines don’t follow full-sentence rules.
F-K treats every line break or period as a sentence,
so ten two-word bullets come out “Grade 0”,
while one breath-less headline shows “Grade 18”.
The number reflects odd punctuation, not real reading effort.

Lengthy jargon or short, unusual names
The formula assumes “more syllables = harder word”.
In practice, a medical student finds cardiomyopathy routine, while a newcomer may stumble.
At the same time, a fantasy story loaded with short,
invented names (Orc, Mordor, Gollum) scores as easy even though the reader still needs to learn them.
Whenever difficulty depends on background knowledge rather than word length, F-K becomes unreliable.
